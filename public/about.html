<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born in Maryland raised in Virgina! Hello, I'm Niya Nixon and I can officialy say I'm a Software Engineer. I'm a 21 year old who is teaching herself how to code. 
  This has always been something I've been interested in but now I am investing in myself and actully doing it
</p>

<p>Outside of coding I play guitar and I play a lot of Call Of Duty sometimes fortnite but It's changed too much for my liking</p>

<p>I also have my own Photography business so If anyone in the Philadelphia area wants pictures I'm your girl!</p>
